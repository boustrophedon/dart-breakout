dart-breakout
=============

i have been doing non-public code for a research project for a while now, and i meant to do this project a long time ago. let's build a breakout clone. let's make it networked.

current progress: you can run a server and have clients join it and they can see each others' paddles move around, there is a ball, there are bricks that break when you hit them.

todo: bricks don't really collide on their sides. the position and velocity of the paddle do not effect the movement of the ball. it would be nice to have powerups. it would be nice for everyone to have a different color and that would be super easy to do.
