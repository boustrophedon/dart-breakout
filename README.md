dart-breakout
=============

i have been doing non-public code for a research project for a while now, and i meant to do this project a long time ago. let's build a breakout clone. let's make it networked.

current progress: you can run a server and have clients join it and they can see each others' paddles move around, there is a ball, there are bricks that break when you hit them.

todo: the position and velocity of the paddle do not affect the movement of the ball. it would be nice to have powerups.
